I would like to enter few sentences at the time (one-by-one)
I would like to cipher and decipher
I would like to choose the shift (for ciphering and deciphering)
Software should distinguish capital leters
Software should not crash on z/Z letters when coding
Software should deal with blank spaces and very long sentences.

What if shift is: 20? -45? Will it work?
What happens with: „Z”, „  „, „ , ”… other marks (interpunction)?

Methods – how to use parts of the code:
def code(given_word, shift):
  do something

def decode(given_word, shift):
  code(given_word, -shift)

Menu loop
  if choice==1:
  	code
  if choice==2:
	  decode
  if choice==3:
 	  exit
